# Controlling the concurrency of Goroutines with given time slots

## How It Works:
1. **Buffered Channel** (`sem`): The channel’s capacity (`maxGoroutines`) controls how many goroutines can run concurrently. It acts as a semaphore.
2. **Ticker (`time.NewTicker`)**: The ticker triggers at a set interval (tickerInterval), which governs when a new batch of goroutines can start.
3. **`for range` Loop**: The for range `ticker.C` loop is used to iterate over each tick, starting a new time slot.
4. **Launching Goroutines**:
    - The loop first starts the minimum number of goroutines (`minGoroutines`).
    - Then, it launches additional goroutines up to the maximum limit (`maxGoroutines`).
5. **Goroutine Cleanup**:
    - Each goroutine releases its slot (`<-sem`) after completion.
    - The `wg.Wait()` ensures all goroutines for the current time slot complete before moving on to the next tick.

### Why Use for range?
The for range `ticker.C` loop simplifies iterating over time slots without needing an explicit condition. It automatically handles each tick and runs indefinitely, making it ideal for managing repeating tasks.

### Output Example:
```bash
Starting new time slot...
Goroutine 0 is running...
Goroutine 1 is running...
Goroutine 2 is running...
Goroutine 3 is running...
Goroutine 4 is running...
Goroutine 0 is done.
Goroutine 1 is done.
Goroutine 2 is done.
Goroutine 3 is done.
Goroutine 4 is done.
All goroutines for this time slot are done.
```

### Key Points:
- The solution is scalable and time-bound. It manages the number of goroutines efficiently using a semaphore and time-based ticks.
- This pattern is useful for batch processing tasks that require fixed concurrency levels and timing constraints.
- The `for range` `ticker.C` loop makes it easy to continuously process jobs at each tick without additional complexity.

This is a flexible way to control the concurrency of goroutines within specific time slots using Go’s native concurrency tools.
