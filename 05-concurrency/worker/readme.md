# The workflow of the above code can be summarized as follows:

### Initialization:
- The main function initializes two channels: tasks and results.
- tasks is used to send tasks to worker goroutines, and results is used to receive the results of the processed tasks.

### Creating Worker Goroutines:
- The main function spawns multiple worker goroutines (determined by the value of numWorkers).
- Each worker goroutine is responsible for processing tasks received from the tasks channel and sending the results back to    the results channel.

### Enqueuing Tasks:
- The main function loops numTasks times, sending tasks to the tasks channel.
- Each task is a Task struct with a unique ID, indicating the task number.

### Processing Tasks:
- Each worker goroutine continuously listens for tasks on the tasks channel.
- When a task is received, the worker goroutine simulates processing time by sleeping for one second.
- After processing the task, the worker goroutine sends the task's ID (result) to the results channel.

### Collecting Results:
- After all tasks are enqueued, the main function starts collecting results from the results channel.
- It loops numTasks times, receiving results from the results channel.
- For each result received, it prints a message indicating that the corresponding task is completed.

### Closing Channels:
- After all tasks are processed and results are collected, the tasks channel is closed.
- This signals to the worker goroutines that no more tasks will be sent, allowing them to gracefully exit after processing     the remaining tasks in their queue.

### Completion:
- The main function exits after all tasks are processed and results are collected.

In summary, the workflow involves creating worker goroutines, sending tasks to be processed, collecting results, and closing channels to signal completion. This concurrent approach allows for efficient processing of tasks using multiple worker goroutines.
