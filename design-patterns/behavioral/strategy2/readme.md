# Strategy Design Pattern
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The strategy pattern allows a client to choose which algorithm to use at runtime.

## Example Scenario: Payment Processing
Imagine you have different payment methods (like credit card, PayPal, or bank transfer). The Strategy pattern allows you to change the payment algorithm dynamically based on user input or other conditions.
